### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rodrigo, a brazilian expat living in the Netherlands. I have been a hobbyist programmer since 1982, but I have worked professionally as a systems analyst/software engineer and developer since 1996. Among my skills, I have been working with Internet technologies for 17+ years, specifically in the banking sector. I am proficient in enterprise systems architecture and system modeling using object-oriented techniques, from analysis to implementation and testing. I coordinate teams of 2-6 developers in both from-scratch systems and maintenance and re-engineering systems (such as client-server systems for the web environment), mainly using Java (Struts/JSF/Spring) and .NET Framework. I also have knowledge of interfaces between hardware and mobile platforms (USB/OBDII). In the academic field, I work with modeling of physical systems using techniques of numerical analysis and languages like Python, FORTRAN and C/C ++.
